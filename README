* ===================================
* note
  * do not insert <tab> in cicada-nymph-mode
  * note that
    auto-indentation is not supported by cicada-nymph-mode
    because
    auto-indentation functions
    written by other people
    always do not satisfy my need
  * while
    I provide the following functions
    to help you to indent your code :
    1. turn-on-indent
    2. turn-off-indent
    3. move-line-foreword
    4. move-line-backword
* note problem
  * sometimes
    when using << >> to comment many lines of code
    syntax highlighting of the comment will fail
  * to kill this bug
    one HAVE TO scan almost the whole buffer
    very frequently
    this will make the performance unacceptable (to me)
  * and
    I will wait for a better text editor to solve this problem
  * I will NOT provide "\" and "end-of-line"
    as a another pair to make comment in cicada-nymph
    NOR will I comment many continuous lines
    with many << >> pairs in my cicada-nymph code
  * because
    my friends and I will write a new text editor
    which is better than emacs
* the way I use cicada-nymph-mode
